# Finshing Touches Request! 💖

To make this website perfect, you need to add your own special files:

## 1. Background Music 🎵
- Find a romantic MP3 file you like.
- Rename it to `music.mp3`.
- Paste it into this folder: `c:\Users\ZENOX\Music\oru cheriya gift\`
- **Need Music?** Check out these free sites:
  - [Pixabay Music](https://pixabay.com/music/search/romantic/)
  - [Chosic](https://www.chosic.com/free-music/romantic/)

## 2. Photos/GIFs 📸
Currently, the site uses cute GIPHY links. If you want to use your own photos:
1. Put your photos in this folder.
2. Open `index.html` in Notepad or VS Code.
3. Look for lines like `<img src="https://media1.giphy.com/..." class="hero-img">`.
4. Change the `src` to your filename (e.g., `src="my_photo.jpg"`).

Enjoy your proposal! 💘
